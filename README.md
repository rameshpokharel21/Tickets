This is Tickets inventory application.
It is only intended for educational purpose.
Tickets based on Vue js and uses JavaScript, Sql js (Sqlite), and browser's IndexedDB.
It is a CRUD operation, where users can keep inventory of scratch off tickets sale.
The data can be saved to a local sqlite file which can be opened with any sqlite application.
Also, sqlite database can be loaded as a source data.
It also has pdf print options from File menu.
